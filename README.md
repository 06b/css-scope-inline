## Why does this exist?

Get an inline Tailwind esque experience in vanilla CSS. Try this if you:

* Want to stay close to vanilla CSS.
* Hate typing individual class and id names over.. and over..
* Wish to co-locate your CSS inline for ⚡️ [Locality of Behavior (LoB)](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/)
* Really wish `this` would work in `<style>` tags.
* No build step. Dependency-free.
* Pairs well with [Surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal) and [htmx](https://htmx.org)
* Want fewer layers, less complexity. Are aware of the cargo cult. ✈️

✨ Want to also inline scope your `<script>` tags? See our companion project, [Surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal)
